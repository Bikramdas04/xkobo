# XKOBO for Mac OS X 

Xkobo is a simple open-source game developed by Akira Higuchi, in 1997. It was originally for X Window system. So I thought that it would be easily runnable on my Mac because the OS X has built-in X Window system. However, I've noticed that it had few difficulties to be compiled. So I've patched few lines of code to have it be compiled, and packaged it as an application. I hope it is useful to other Mac OS X users as well. 

Be careful not to be addicted!
